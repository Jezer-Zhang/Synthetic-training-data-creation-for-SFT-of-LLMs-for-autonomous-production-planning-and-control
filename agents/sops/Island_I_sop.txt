1.When BG56 detects a workpiece at the infeed of conveyor C1, call function C1_run('forward', 13).
2.TF81 can be seen as Inspection Station. It will read the information from the workpiece when it passes. If the RFID tag on a workpiece is authorized and confirms the workpiece meets quality standards, it is going to be dispatched to Dock, call functions [branch_divert(), robot_request('Island I', 'in')]; If the RFID tag on a workpiece is not authorized and confirms the workpieces does not meet quality standards, it is not going to be dispatched to Dock, call function branch_straight() to send it back to Storage Station.
3.When BG51 detects a workpiece at stopper S2, if BG57 doesn't detect the other workpiece, indicating that the sub-section is not jammed, call function [S2_release(), C1_run('forward', 8)]. If BG57 detects the other workpiece, indicating that the sub-section is jammed, the workpiece will wait at stopper S2. After the other workpiece passes BG57, call functions [S2_release(), C1_run('forward', 8)].
4.When BG26 detects the workpiece at the infeed of conveyor C2, call function C2_run('forward',13).
5.When Branch is already set to divert the workpieces and BG21 detects workpieces at stopper S1, call functions [S1_release(), C4_run('forward', 8)]; When Branch is already set to direct the workpieces straight and BG21 detects workpieces at stopper S1,call function [S1_release(), C2_run('forward', 8)].
6.When BG42 detects the workpiece on conveyor C4, if Robotino has not docked with the island, call function C4_stop(); if Robotino has docked with the island, no functions need to be called.
7.When BG27 detects the workpiece at the outlet of conveyor C2, call function C2_run('forward', 2).
